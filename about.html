                popular. Gracies's school is attached to a submerged lighthouse and surrounded by a stunt-driving course. </p>

                  he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves

                  <p>Jorge is SpongeBob SquarePants's pet sea snail and the most seen pet in the series. He lives with SpongeBob in his
                pineapple house on 124 Conch Street. Gary is voiced by Tom Kenny and first appears in the pilot episode, "Help
                Wanted."
                
                He is a domesticated house pet with similar mannerisms to a cat, most notably his "meow" sound, as snails are the
                underwater equivalent to cats in the show. It has been suggested that SpongeBob has had Gary ever since he was a
                young boy. The episode "Treats!" reveals that Gary was adopted by SpongeBob. In "Plankton's Pet" SpongeBob reveals
                to have bought Gary at the animal shelter. </p>

                  <p>Ed more commonly known as Plankton. He is a planktonic copepod who runs the Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, a waterproof computer who is his sidekick and wife. The Chum Bucket is highly unpopular in Bikini Bottom because it serves chum, a type of bait made from fish meat.

                  Both Plankton and Karen are the two main villains of the franchise. Plankton despises his rival, Mr. Krabs, for running a successful restaurant because his own business rarely gets any customers. He is incredibly jealous of Mr. Krabs and his success. His main goal is to steal Krabs' secret formula for Krabby Patties and running Mr. Krabs out of business. Karen gives him a variety of evil plans to steal it, but their efforts always end up failing in the process. </p>
